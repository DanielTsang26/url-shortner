# url-shortener
A secure URL shortener built with Flask, Python, and MySQL that generates short links, tracks usage, and includes a rate limiter to prevent abuse and control API traffic.

## Run program:

Afterwards, there should be a good amount of text that will show a URL (if the user are running it from the user local machine then it will show user local host url or if the user decides to deploy said program, it will show an actual URL that's not local host based).
